# DCS War Room

A digital combat simulator oriented flight and combat stats system powered by tacview

This application is based on electron.

I'm not particularly FOND of electron however with other offerings such as NodeGUI having (at the moment of making this project) catastrophic issues (view their vueJS version and the current abandonment / lack of issue replies) **this is the only one at the moment that will allow for a cross platform application to be built, all other offerings have issues with their default test example applications! (I'm looking at you too, TAURI! (Google "tauri thread '<unnamed>' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Os" for more weird issues))**. Ugh! Anyway...

Again, I'm not FOND of electron, but it's the only one that works that allows me to bang out a UI for this project. We can address / change this later and get help with particulars with porting this to another framework if need be at a later date.
