[SQL Lite Studio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/) - Great for dealing with the SQL Lite database

[Tacview](https://www.tacview.net/product/about/en/) - You do not need the paid for version for this to run, but it's a great app and I highly encourage you to purchase this - they are a great group of devs!
